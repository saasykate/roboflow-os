  <div class="section" id="intro">
    <h2><code>intro()</code> – Start Here</h2>
    <p><strong>This isn’t a traditional handbook. It’s a window into how we work at Roboflow.</strong></p>
    <p>We’re a mission-driven team, building the infrastructure for the future of computer vision. This document exists to make our expectations clear, to help you decide if Roboflow is the right place for you, and to guide how we work together as we grow.</p>
    <p>We’re sharing it publicly because we believe great teams build in the open — with trust, clarity, and shared context.</p>
  </div>


<div class="section" id="boot">
    <h2><code>boot()</code></h2>
    <h3>Welcome & Mission</h3>
    <p>At Roboflow, we’re on a mission to make the world programmable. We believe the next wave of progress will come from teaching computers to see — and we’re building the platform to make that possible for every developer, every team, and every company.</p>
    <p>Our mission is ambitious — and so is our culture. To win, we need to move fast, take ownership, and surround ourselves with people who raise our standards. That’s what this handbook is about: how we work, what we value, and why Roboflow might be the best place you’ve ever worked — or the fastest place you decide isn’t for you.</p>
    <p>This culture isn't for everyone. That's intentional.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="handbook">
    <h2><code>handbook.describe()</code></h2>
    <h3>What This Handbook Is</h3>
    <p>This is not a policy document.<br/>
    This is not a list of benefits.<br/>
    It’s how we work.</p>
    <p>It’s a shared understanding of what we expect from each other — and what you can expect from Roboflow. We hold ourselves to a high bar, because we’re building something that matters.</p>
    <p>We’re sharing it publicly because we believe great companies are built in the open.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="team">
    <h2><code>teammates.raise_bar()</code></h2>
    <h3>What We Look For</h3>
    <p>At Roboflow, we don’t think of ourselves as a family or a factory. We’re a team of builders — people who are world-class in our domains, deeply collaborative, and aligned around a shared mission. Great teams raise each other’s standards and help each other win. That’s what we do here.</p>
    <p>We don’t hire for pedigree. We hire for impact. We look for people who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bias toward action</strong> — You move quickly, build things fast, and ship improvements before they’re perfect.</li>
      <li><strong>Communicate clearly</strong> — You write and speak in ways that help others move forward with context and confidence.</li>
      <li><strong>Challenge with care</strong> — You offer direct feedback and invite it in return. You make the work better without making it personal.</li>
      <li><strong>Work in the open</strong> — You value transparency, share what you’re learning, and default to documentation and visibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Own the outcomes</strong> — You take pride in the results. You dig into the data. You fix the broken thing even if it’s not your “job.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We hold each other to high standards. And we believe it’s more respectful to be honest than to protect someone from the truth. That’s why we practice radical candor and assume positive intent. We also believe great teammates coach each other and make the whole team better, not just themselves.</p>
    <p>We pay at the top of market to attract and retain exceptional people. And we regularly ask ourselves: “If this person were thinking of leaving, would I fight to keep them?” If the answer is no, we owe them honest feedback — and the opportunity to find a better fit elsewhere. This isn’t about loyalty. It’s about building the best possible team to pursue an ambitious mission.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="trust">
    <h2><code>trust.default()</code></h2>
    <h3>Default to Trust</h3>
    <p>Roboflow works because we trust our people — with information, with decisions, and with our reputation. We believe people do their best work when they have context and autonomy, not control and permission.</p>
    <p>We don’t write policies for edge cases or lowest common denominators. Our vacation policy is: “Take what you need.” Our expense policy is: “Act in Roboflow’s best interest.” Our process is: “Make it easy to do the right thing.”</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Managers give context, not commands.</strong> They coach, they unblock, they don’t micromanage.</li>
      <li><strong>Everyone is a decision-maker.</strong> We assign a “DRI” (Directly Responsible Individual) for every important choice — and we expect them to farm for dissent before deciding.</li>
      <li><strong>Once a decision is made, we “disagree and commit.”</strong> Debate happens before, not after.</li>
      <li><strong>We ship fast, learn fast, and fix fast.</strong> Perfection isn’t the goal — forward momentum is.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Trust also means giving people access to what’s happening across the company. We work in the open, document decisions, and default to transparency — whether it’s metrics, strategy, or mistakes. We believe anyone at Roboflow should be able to answer “why are we doing this?” and “how can I help?”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="distributed">
  <h2><code>work.distributed()</code> – How We Work Together</h2>
  <p>Roboflow is a distributed company. That means we build processes and culture around flexibility, autonomy, and clarity — not physical location.</p>
  <p>We optimize for async communication and written documentation so that work can move forward no matter the time zone. You’ll see us default to sharing context in Slack threads, recording important meetings, and writing decisions down instead of relying on hallway conversations.</p>
  <p>Distributed doesn’t mean disconnected. We invest in meaningful in-person time — through onsites, team meetups, and strategy sessions — so that when we are together, it’s intentional and energizing.</p>
  <p>What matters most isn’t where you work — it’s how you work. And we’ve built Roboflow to support exceptional people doing focused, impactful work wherever they are.</p>
</div>

  <div class="section" id="build">
    <h2><code>build() → scale()</code></h2>
    <h3>Why We Move Fast</h3>
    <p>We’re not here to play it safe. We’re here to push the frontier of what’s possible — in computer vision, in AI infrastructure, and in how fast teams can move with the right tools.</p>
    <p>Working at Roboflow should feel uncomfortably exciting. We believe that’s where the best growth happens — when you’re a little stretched, a little uncertain, and a lot motivated.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Run toward ambiguity instead of away from it.</li>
      <li>Bet on big ideas, even if they fail fast.</li>
      <li>Try new experiments without waiting for perfect plans.</li>
      <li>Expect fast feedback loops — from customers, from teammates, from ourselves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We’re solving hard technical and product challenges, and there’s no playbook. That means we need people who thrive in motion, stay grounded in first principles, and can build their own clarity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="better">
    <h2><code>great.then_better()</code></h2>
    <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
    <p>We’re proud of how far we’ve come, but even more excited about where we’re going. Our mindset is: “Great today. Better tomorrow.”</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We run retros. We own what didn’t work. We get better, together.</li>
      <li>We invite feedback early and often — and treat it as a gift, not a threat.</li>
      <li>We invest in our own learning, and coach each other to level up.</li>
      <li>We fix problems when we find them. We don’t wait for someone else to do it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We believe culture is a product — and like any good product, it evolves. Every person who joins Roboflow makes us different, and we embrace that. We improve how we work just like we improve what we build: with curiosity, data, and iteration.</p>
    <p>Our goal isn’t to preserve Roboflow. It’s to continually earn the right to exist — by delivering real value to our users, and creating a company where exceptional people want to stay and grow.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="notfor">
    <h2><code>not_for.everyone()</code></h2>
    <h3>Intentional Intensity</h3>
    <p>We’re intense. We move fast. We expect a lot. We write more than we talk. We ship before we polish. We push each other to be better.</p>
    <p>But we also trust deeply. We support one another. We value honesty over harmony, and outcomes over politics.</p>
    <p>Roboflow isn’t for everyone. But for the right people — the curious, driven, kind builders who want to change the world — it might be exactly what you’ve been looking for.</p>
