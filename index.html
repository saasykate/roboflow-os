      <h1>The system behind how we work</h1>
      <p>This isn’t a traditional handbook. It’s a window into how we work — the principles, habits, and expectations that guide us as we build the infrastructure for the future of computer vision.</p>
      <p>We’re on a mission to make the world programmable by giving every developer, team, and company the ability to teach computers to see. It’s ambitious, and so is our culture. We move fast, take ownership, and surround ourselves with people who raise the bar — and help each other rise to meet it.</p>
      <p>This Operating System is our shared understanding of what we expect from each other, and what you can expect from Roboflow. We hold ourselves to a high bar because we’re building something that matters.</p>
      <p>Our culture isn’t for everyone — and that’s intentional. For some, it will be challenging, exhilarating, and deeply rewarding. For others, it may not be the environment where they do their best work. Either way, this guide will help you decide if Roboflow is the place for you to do the most meaningful work of your career.</p>
      <p>We share it publicly because great teams build in the open — with trust, clarity, and shared context.</p>

        <h2>Raising the Bar</h2>
        <p>Roboflow is a team of builders — world-class in our domains, deeply collaborative, and united by a shared mission. Great teams raise each other’s standards and help each other win, every day.</p>
        <p><strong>We hire for impact.</strong> We look for people who:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bias toward action</strong> — Move quickly, build fast, and ship improvements before they’re perfect. One teammate rebuilt our core image pipeline in their first month, cutting processing time in half.</li>
          <li><strong>Communicate clearly</strong> — Share context in ways that help others move forward with confidence.</li>
          <li><strong>Challenge with care</strong> — Offer direct feedback and invite it in return, making the work better without making it personal.</li>
          <li><strong>Work in the open</strong> — Document decisions, share learnings, and default to visibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Own the outcomes</strong> — Take pride in results, dig into the data, and fix the broken thing even if it’s outside your job description.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We believe honesty is a form of respect. We practice radical candor, assume positive intent, and coach each other to get better.</p>
        <p>We pay at the top of market to attract and retain exceptional talent. We regularly ask ourselves: <em>If this person were considering leaving, would I fight to keep them?</em> If the answer is no, we give direct feedback and the support needed to level up or find a better fit.</p>
        <p>Our focus is simple: build the strongest possible team to pursue an ambitious mission.</p>

      <section id="how-we-work">
        <h2>How We Work Together</h2>
        <p>Roboflow is a distributed company by design — we hire the best people wherever they are and support them with clear expectations, async tools, and regular opportunities to connect live.</p>
        <p>We default to written communication, document decisions, and design for time zone flexibility. But we also know some of the best ideas come from spontaneous conversations, so we invest in our hubs in <strong>New York</strong> and <strong>San Francisco</strong> as energizing, productive spaces. Some of our biggest breakthroughs started at a whiteboard in New York, over lunch in San Francisco, or during an onsite brainstorm that shaped a year of roadmap.</p>
        <p>We bring the full company together regularly at <strong>onsites</strong> to align on strategy, deepen relationships, and re-energize around our mission. Wherever you work, you’ll have meaningful face time when it counts.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="how-we-win">
        <h2>How We Win</h2>
        <p>We move fast because we’re here to push the frontier — in computer vision, in AI infrastructure, and in how quickly great teams can deliver with the right tools. Playing it safe doesn’t change the world.</p>
        <p>Working here should feel uncomfortably exciting. The best growth happens when you’re a little stretched, a little uncertain, and a lot motivated. We run toward ambiguity, bet on big ideas, and experiment without waiting for perfect plans. Feedback loops are fast — from customers, teammates, and ourselves — because learning quickly matters more than being right the first time.</p>
        <p>We improve relentlessly. “Great today, better tomorrow” isn’t just a mantra — it’s how we work. We run retros, own what didn’t work, and make changes immediately. We treat feedback as a gift, invest in our own learning, and coach each other to level up. Problems get fixed when they’re found, not when they’re assigned.</p>
        <p>Our culture is a product, and like any product, it evolves. Every person who joins shapes it. We’re not here to preserve Roboflow as it is — we’re here to continually earn the right to exist by delivering real value to users and creating a place where exceptional people want to stay and grow.</p>
        <p>We expect a lot — from ourselves and each other. We write more than we talk. We ship before we polish. We push each other to be better, and we trust each other deeply. We value honesty over harmony and outcomes over politics.</p>
        <p>Roboflow isn’t for everyone. But for curious, driven, kind builders who want to change the world, it might be exactly what you’ve been looking for.</p>
